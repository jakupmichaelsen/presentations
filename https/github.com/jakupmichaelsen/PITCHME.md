### Language functions  

A simple way to categorize the functions of languge is into three categories:  

1. **Informative language function** <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
##### Essentially, the communication of information. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
2. **Expressive language function** <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
##### Reports feelings or attitudes of the writer (or speaker), or of the subject, or evokes feelings in the reader (or listener) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
3. **Directive language function** <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
##### Language used for the purpose of causing (or preventing) overt action. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
